ABSTRACT:
  This project is about predicting a area coverage and its covertype of forest fire based on the previous datasets collected form online sources.
  In this project the machine learning algorithms used are Extra Tree Classifier and Random forest.

Slit 1:
  Importing libraries and defining datasets.

Slit 2:
  Analyzing datasets and representing datasets through various mapping functionus using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

Slit 3:
  Importing machine learning models such as ExtraTreeClasssifier and Randomforest.

Slit 4:
  Splitting of training and testing datasets for train and test the predictivity of the model.

Slit 5:
  After testing the model and comparing the predicted values and test dataset values, we can finding acurracy.
